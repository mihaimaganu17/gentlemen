            Just wanted to confirm that I’m looking forward to our meeting tomorrow at 10 AM. 
            Let me know if the location has changed or if there’s anything I should prepare in advance. 
            I'll bring the quarterly reports we discussed. See you then!\n\n

            As promised, here are the next steps for Project Roma. I've outlined them in detail at the following link:

            Feel free to leave comments directly on the doc if anything looks off.\n\n

            Attached you’ll find the full report from our recent experiment using Azure Kubernetes Service. 
            We tested deployment speed, autoscaling behavior, and resource optimization under high load. 
            Initial results look promising — especially on the cost/performance ratio. Let’s discuss it in more detail during our next tech review.\n\n
            Regards,\n
            David"
